\chapter{\label{ch:vspace}Address Spaces and Virtual Memory}

A virtual address space in seL4 is called a VSpace. In a similar
way to a CSpace (see \autoref{ch:cspace}), a VSpace is composed of objects 
provided by the microkernel. Unlike CSpaces, these objects for managing
virtual memory largely correspond to those of the hardware;
that is, a page directory pointing to page tables, which in turn map
physical frames.  The kernel also includes \obj{ASID Pool} and
\obj{ASID Control} objects for tracking the status of address spaces.

These VSpace-related objects are sufficient to implement the
hardware data structures required to create, manipulate, and destroy
virtual memory address spaces. It should be noted that, as usual, the
manipulator of a virtual memory space needs the appropriate
capabilities to the required objects.

\section{Overview}
\ifxeightsix
\paragraph{IA-32}

IA-32 processors have a two-level page-table structure.
The top-level page directory covers a 4\,GiB range and each page table covers a 4\,MiB range.
Frames can be 4\,KiB or 4\,MiB.
Before a 4KiB
frame can be mapped, a page table covering the range that the frame will
be mapped into must have been mapped, otherwise seL4 will return an
error.
4\,MiB frames are mapped directly into the page directory, thus,
a page table does not need to be mapped first.
\fi

\paragraph{ARM}

ARM processors \ifxeightsix{also }\fi have a two-level page-table structure.
The top-level page directory covers a range of 4\,GiB and each page table covers a 1\,MiB range.
Four page sizes are allowed: 4\,KiB, 64\,KiB, 1\,MiB and 16\,MiB.
4\,KiB and 64\,KiB pages are mapped into the second-level page table.
Before
they can be mapped, a page table covering the range that they will be
mapped into must have been installed.
1\,MiB and 16\,MiB pages are installed directly into the page directory such that it is not necessary to map a page table first.
Pages of 4\,KiB and 1\,MiB size occupy one slot in a page table and the page directory, respectively.
Pages of 64\,KiB and 16\,MiB size occupy 16 slots in a page table and the page directory, respectively.


\section{Objects}

\paragraph{\obj{Page Directory}}

The \obj{Page Directory} (PD) is the top-level page table of the 
two-level page table structure. It has a hardware-defined format, but
conceptually contains a number of page directory entries (PDEs).
The \obj{Page Directory} has no methods itself, but it is used
as an argument to several other virtual-memory related object invocations.

\paragraph{\obj{Page Table}} The \obj{Page Table} (PT) object forms the
second level of the page-table structure.
It contains a number of slots, each of which contains a page-table entry (PTE).

\newcommand{\vmfunc}[2]{{#1}\par{\addtolength{\leftskip}{2em}{#2}\par}}

\obj{Page Table} objects possess only two methods:
\vspace{2ex}\\
\vmfunc{
\apifunc{seL4\_ARM\_PageTable\_Map}{arm_pagetable_map}\\
\ifxeightsix\apifunc{seL4\_IA32\_PageTable\_Map}{ia32_pagetable_map}\fi
}{
Takes a \obj{Page Directory} capability as an argument, and installs a reference to the invoked
\obj{Page Table} in a specified slot in the \obj{Page Directory}.
}
\vspace{2ex}
\vmfunc{
\apifunc{seL4\_ARM\_PageTable\_Unmap}{arm_pagetable_unmap}\\
\ifxeightsix\apifunc{seL4\_IA32\_PageTable\_Unmap}{ia32_pagetable_unmap}\fi
}{
Removes the reference to the invoked \obj{Page Table} from its containing
\obj{Page Directory}.
}

\paragraph{\obj{Page}}

A \obj{Page} object is a region of physical memory that is used to
implement virtual memory pages in a virtual address space. The
\obj{Page} object has the following methods:
\vspace{2ex}\\
\vmfunc{
\apifunc{seL4\_ARM\_Page\_Map}{arm_page_map}\\
\ifxeightsix\apifunc{seL4\_IA32\_Page\_Map}{ia32_page_map}\fi
}{
Takes a \obj{Page Directory} capability as an argument and installs a reference
to the given \obj{Page} in the PD or PT slot corresponding to the given address.
}\vspace{2ex}

\vmfunc{
\apifunc{seL4\_ARM\_Page\_Remap}{arm_page_remap}\\
\ifxeightsix\apifunc{seL4\_IA32\_Page\_Remap}{ia32_page_remap}\fi
}{
Changes the permissions of an existing mapping.
}\vspace{2ex}

\vmfunc{
\apifunc{seL4\_ARM\_Page\_Unmap}{arm_page_unmap}\\
\ifxeightsix\apifunc{seL4\_IA32\_Page\_Unmap}{ia32_page_unmap}\fi
}{
Removes an existing mapping.
}\vspace{2ex}

The virtual address for a \obj{Page} mapping
must be aligned to
the size of the \obj{Page} and must be mapped to a suitable \obj{Page Directory}
or \obj{Page Table}. To map a page readable, the capability
to the page
that is being invoked must have read permissions. To map the page
writable, the capability must have write permissions. The requested
mapping permissions are specified with an argument of type
\texttt{seL4\_CapRights} given to the \apifunc{seL4\_ARM\_Page\_Map}{arm_page_map} \ifxeightsix or \apifunc{seL4\_IA32\_Page\_Map}{ia32_page_map} \fi method.
\texttt{seL4\_CanRead} and \texttt{seL4\_CanWrite} are the only valid
permissions on \ifxeightsix both \else the \fi ARM \ifxeightsix and IA-32 \fi architecture\ifxeightsix{s}\fi. If the capability does not have
sufficient permissions to authorise the given mapping, then
the mapping permissions are silently downgraded.

\paragraph{\obj{ASID Control}}

For internal kernel book-keeping purposes, there is a fixed maximum
number of applications the system can support.  In order to manage
this limited resource, the microkernel provides an \obj{ASID Control}
capability. The \obj{ASID Control} capability is used to generate a
capability that authorises the use of a subset of available address-space identifiers.
This newly created capability is called an
\obj{ASID Pool}. \obj{ASID Control} only has a single method:
\vspace{2ex}\\
\vmfunc{
\apifunc{seL4\_ARM\_ASIDControl\_MakePool}{arm_asidcontrol_makepool}\\
\ifxeightsix\apifunc{seL4\_IA32\_ASIDControl\_MakePool}{ia32_ASID_controlmakepool}\fi
}{
Together with a capability to 
\obj{Untyped Memory} as argument creates an \obj{ASID Pool}.
}\vspace{2ex}

The untyped
capability given to the \apifunc{seL4\_ARM\_ASIDControl\_MakePool}{arm_asidcontrol_makepool} call must represent a 4K memory object.
This will create an ASID pool with enough space for 1024 VSpaces.

\paragraph{\obj{ASID Pool}}

An \obj{ASID Pool} confers the right to create a subset of the available
maximum applications. For a VSpace to be usable by an application, it
must be assigned to an ASID. This is done using a capability to an
\obj{ASID Pool}. The \obj{ASID Pool} object has a single method:
\vspace{2ex}\\
\vmfunc{
\apifunc{seL4\_ARM\_ASIDPool\_Assign}{arm_asidpool_assign}\\
\ifxeightsix\apifunc{seL4\_IA32\_ASIDPool\_Assign}{ia32_ASID_poolassign}\fi
}{
Assigns an ASID to the VSpace
associated with the \obj{Page Directory} passed in as an argument.
}

\section{Mapping Attributes}
A parameter of type \texttt{seL4\_ARM\_VMAttributes} or
\texttt{seL4\_IA32\_VMAttributes} is used to specify the cache behaviour of the
page being mapped; possible values for ARM are shown in \autoref{tbl:vmattr_arm} \ifxeightsix and values for IA-32 are shown in \autoref{tbl:vmattr_ia32}\fi.

\begin{table}[htb]
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{p{0.33\textwidth}X}
      \toprule
      Attribute & Meaning \\
      \midrule
      \texttt{seL4\_ARM\_PageCacheable} & Enable data in this mapping
      to be cached \\
      \texttt{seL4\_ARM\_ParityEnabled} & Enable parity checking for
      this mapping\\
      \bottomrule
    \end{tabularx}
    \caption{\label{tbl:vmattr_arm} Virtual memory attributes for ARM page
      table entries.}
  \end{center}
\end{table}

\begin{table}[htb]
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{p{0.33\textwidth}X}
      \toprule
      Attribute & Meaning \\
      \midrule
      \texttt{seL4\_IA32\_CacheDisabled} & Prevent data in this mapping
      from being cached \\
      \texttt{seL4\_IA32\_WriteThrough} & Enable write through cacheing for this mapping \\
      \texttt{seL4\_IA32\_WriteCombining} & Enable write combining for this mapping \\
      \bottomrule
    \end{tabularx}
    \caption{\label{tbl:vmattr_ia32} Virtual memory attributes for IA32 page
      table entries.}
  \end{center}
\end{table}

\section{Sharing Memory}

seL4 does not allow \obj{Page Table}s to be shared, but does allow
pages to be shared between address spaces. 
To share a page, the capability to the 
\obj{Page} must first be
duplicated using the \apifunc{seL4\_CNode\_Copy}{cnode_copy} method and the new copy must
be used in the \apifunc{seL4\_ARM\_Page\_Map}{arm_page_map} \ifxeightsix or \apifunc{seL4\_IA32\_Page\_Map}{ia32_page_map} \fi method that maps the page into the second
address space. Attempting to map the same capability
twice will result in an error. 


\section{Page Faults}

Page faults are reported to the exception handler of the executed thread.
See \autoref{sec:vm-fault}.
