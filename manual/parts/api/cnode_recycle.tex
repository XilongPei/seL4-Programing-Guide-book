{CNode  -  Recycle}
{The recycle method is intended roughly as a short cut for reusing an
object within the same protection domain. The method will first revoke the
capability and will then reset some but not necessarily all aspects of an
object to its neutral state. Recycling badged endpoint caps will only cancel
IPCs for this badge. Recycled frames, page tables and directories should only
be re-used in the same protection domain, not all authority to them is
rescinded. For full reuse in a different protection domain, revoke and retype
the untyped cap that was used to create the object. For the precise behaviour
of recycle, see the formal specification.}
